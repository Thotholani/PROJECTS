### What I learned

I learned how to easily vertically center an element using flexbox. This can be done by assigning a height to the element, giving it a display of flex and finally by using align-items: center to move the element to the center of the page relative to the assigned height.

```html
<section class="url"></section>
```

```css
.url {
    min-height: 100vh;
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
}
}
```
